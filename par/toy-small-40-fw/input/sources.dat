% Definition of (distributed) source positions: 
% position, time-delay, centre frequency, and amplitude
%
% (comment line is indicated by # as first character)
%
% Parameters for each source node (one source node per line):
%
%  NSRC (one separateline)
% 	XSRC		YSRC		ZSRC		TD		FC		AMP
%
% Symbols: 
% XSRC= x-coordinate of source point [meter]
% YSRC= y-coordinate of source point [meter] (vertical)
% ZSRC= z-coordinate of source point [meter] 
% TD= excitation time (time-delay) for source node [s]
% FC= centre frequency of source signal [Hz]
% AMP= maximum amplitude of source signal
